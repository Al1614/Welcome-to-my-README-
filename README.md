# Welcome-to-my-README-
Hello! 😄

- I am a full stack software engineer in training. I fell in love with coding at a younger age through video games, phones, computers and wanted to know what went in to making them and how they function. I live in northeastern Pennsylvania and have college experience mixed with professional experience over 5 years at a young age in my life. 🎮

- I am someone who is always seeking to improve my skills or add more to my toolbox, so that I can not only better myself but a company as well. My professional experience has allowed me to learn so much in the real world and become a suitable candidate for any company that is looking for someone to better it. 👨🏻‍💻

- After teaching myself some programming/coding I decided to enroll in Coding Dojo, a bootcamp geared towards learning languages in their entirety through working on dev teams, collaboration with others, and the opportunity to help other students. This allows me to maximize my potential as a full stack developer and engineer to be prepared to work for a great company. 💻📱
